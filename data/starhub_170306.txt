Dear StarHub Support    I tried to change my Hub ID password this evening but the system did not  allow me.    Please see the attached screen capture.  My password definitely is between  8 to 25 alphanumeric characters and has at least 1 number and 1 letter but  the system refused to let me change my password.   Please refer to the  messages next to the New Password and Confirm Password fields.  They  both indicate that my pasword is strong and matches.  I think there might  be a problem with the server-end validation code.  Please help check.

So  I wanted to link my mobile account <account>1.15017670L</account> and when I clicked the above  link and entered my NRIC number and clicked the NEXT button I saw the  following message: The NRIC / FIN you provided already exists in the  system. Please enter new one. Please advise how this can be done. At  present I do not have any other account with Starhub.    (2) In my profile page my email address is given as  <email>migration@starhub.com</email> which  cannot be edited. As this is not my email address I cannot access it. How  should I provide my email address to receive messages from Starhub?    Appreciate your prompt response.

Hi        I was using pre-paid number (handphone <phone>98149106</phone>) which was linked to HUB ID (<hubid>singhbrijeshk@hotmail.com</hubid>; FIN: <nric>G5072200M</nric>). I have converted this pre-paid number to post-paid last year keeping my handphone number same. Now I want to see bills online and want to use online services but while logging in webpage showed HUB ID is not linked to StarHub account. If I try to link after filling my FIN it says the NRIC is already in system please use another ID. However I have used same FIN while converting pre-paid to post-paid.      Please do the needful and let me know if anything required from side.

Dear Hub ID support team    I have been trying to reset my password for multiple times and all my  passwords have been rejected.

Hi    I am facing the below issues.  I need to access to my account.  However there is always this error message coming out and thus I am not able to upgrade my hub ID in order to link all my accounts.  I had sent this yesterday and no reply.  Called to starhub 1633 and encounter an extremely rude officer Mr <name>Austin</name> from mobile service department.  He is not willingly to help me in getting the issues resolved. Worse he do not even listen attentively to my problems resulting in me keep repeating my problems.  This is a very bad customer service provided by Starhub.  Just wonder if staffs are not being well-trained and allowed staffs to reply rudely with sarcastic remarks to customers?  I am still waiting for manager to call me but till now nothing has been heard.

Hi team    I've got a few issues and hope you can help me with it.    1. I cant receive the OTP to link my accounts    2. I have just recently signed Broadband service and Cable TV with Starhub  only to realize that the WiFi connections to my family members' cellphone  drops every other 30 - 60 mins. It isn't a first that I feedback on this  issue. And most of the time I had to re-start the router. How often should  I be doing this ? A friend of mine had to actually buy another router to  secure the connection. What is the point if i may ask. *I'm regretting my  port over.*    3. I've spoken with the counter lady during my sign up. I was inquiring on  the cancellation of our cable TV on my Father's NRIC and her advice was  once the new Cable TV Account is setup cancellation will be automatic.  However we are charge both on my father's account and mine.      Kindly assist.

Hi    The number is registered under my name and FIN not the company. I have been very clear in this. I have been trying FOR TWO WEEKS to get this sorted. Everyone else on this corporate plan has managed to get their hub IDs activated - because it is under their names as is mine - and yet I have to deal with Long delayed replies and staff who are clearly taking the lazy route and not assisting me to do something that is clearly possible.    Please have someone call my phone TODAY to discuss this. I will be complaining to BHP's head of supply about the poor service and suggesting they reconsider StarHub as our preferred provider.

Dear Customer Serviceperson    As usual with so many online 'facilities' in Singapore I am unable to get  a Starhub ID so that I can redeem the many points I have accumulated over  my years with Starhub.    My Account Number is *<account>1.11816575R</account>*.  I have checked and re-checked that  repeatedly.  Neverthless your site refuses to accept this account number  as 'valid' which I find absolutely absurd.  Here is a screenshot to show  you exactly what happens:    [image: Inline image 1]    All I want to do is redeem my points before any of them expire.  Do you  think you can manage something that simple for me?    <name>Michael Rebaczonok</name>  *<phone>9353 7940</phone>  (mobile)*      ______________________  This email has been scanned  by the StarHub Managed   Email Security System  ______________________

Hi Customer Support    I have a problem trying to login using HUB iD on my mobile phone or TVB E news app.  When I use my laptop to login to StarHub services or view my account there is no issue to login.  But when I try to login in using my handphone it will reflect as wrong password.  When the 1st time it says wrong password I proceed to change my password but it still didnâ€™t work.  When I try to login in from laptop to view my account using the new password I can login.  It seems like the problem is from using handphone to login in.  Is there any special setting to setup on phone?  My HUBiD is <hubid>elsie_chong@yahoo.com.sg</hubid> .    Thank you for your attention.

Hi    I do not remember myself signing up for the HubID but when I tried to sign  up for an account the error indicated that my NRIC number is already in  the system. So I tried to go through the 'forget HubID' route and the  security question is 'what is your NRIC/FIN/passport number'. I have tried  both my NRIC number and my passport number but both answers were wrong.    I suspect that someone might have used my NRIC number to create an account.  Could you help me check please? I am currently not a Starhub Mobile  customer but I'm trying to convert to from Singtel to Starhub and would  like to create an account. Thanks.

Hi:    I would need help to log onto my account with Starhub. Had tried to click  on the options of Forgot your HubID and when it asked me for my wedding  anniversary as a security question I keyed in the date but it says that  the answer is wrong. I could not have forgotten my wedding anniversary but  there is so many date format that it could be the reason that it is wrong.  For example my wedding date is on a single digit day and month. So I could  have keyed in dmyy and it is a valid date. It could also be on the ddmmyy  format or ddmmyyyy format.    Please assist.    Many thanks.    <name>Teck Yeow</name>      ______________________  This email has been scanned  by the StarHub Managed   Email Security System  ______________________

Hi Sir/Madam    I recently signed up from a personal Mobile Account with Starhub to a Corporate line.    My number is <phone>8268 2533</phone> IC: <nric>S7587400F</nric>.    I am trying to access/check the usage of the phone line before it was changed to corporate line but seems I am no longer able to access it using my hub id (I guess normal).  However at the same time I am no longer to register a new hub id with the same IC number as it tells me it is already existing.  Do I have to wait till the last bill is cleared or something ?    Thanks to advise.
